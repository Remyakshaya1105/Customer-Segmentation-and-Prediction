# Customer-Segmentation-and-Prediction
Customer Segmentation and Prediction is a machine learning project that segments customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and predicts customer segments using supervised learning models. This project helps businesses understand customer behavior and support data-driven decision making.
 # Project Overview
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing patterns  
- Built RFM features to segment customers  
- Applied machine learning models for customer segment prediction  
- Deployed the final model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
# Technologies Used 
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn    
- LightGBM  
- Streamlit
# Machine Learning Models
- K-Means Clustering (for segmentation)
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Random Forest Classifier  
- LightGBM Classifier (final selected model)
  # Customer Segments
- Regular Customers  
- Loyal Customers  
- Churned Customers  
- At Risk Customers
# Application
- A Streamlit web app is built where users can input RFM values and get the predicted customer segment instantly. 
 # Conclusion
-This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be used to segment customers effectively and support business decision-making.
